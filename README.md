# CSC-494: Learning with AI

## Topics covered
- Hardware: user IO (buttons and display), in order to show the user the current celestial coordinates that the telescope is pointing at and so they can choose what object to track
- Hardware: stepper motors, which are required to move the two axes on the telescope mount
- Software: how to drive the motors and how to handle user input with physical buttons

## How will AI be used?
I will use AI in more of an advisory role, asking it general questions about an approach or specifics of the implementation. I don't want to generate code necessarily; I just want to be pointed in the right direction.
